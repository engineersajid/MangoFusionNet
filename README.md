# üçã MangoFusionNet: Mango Variety Classification

This repository contains the implementation and validation of **MangoFusionNet**, a deep learning framework for automatic mango variety classification. The model achieves **98.33% test accuracy** on the **MangoClassify-12 dataset**, which contains **3,900 raw images** of 12 mango varieties, augmented to a total of **7,200 images**. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: [MangoClassify-12 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/researchersajid/mangoclassify-12-native-mango-dataset-from-bd). The model integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques for interpretability and uses **K-Fold cross-validation** for robust performance evaluation.
